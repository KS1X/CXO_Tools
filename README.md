## What is the security & privacy status of this tool?

- The QR tool is a static site, we do not store or track any data that's entered into the QR Tool.
- The QR tool cannot police what destination URLs are used to create QR codes. It's up to the user to determine what is an acceptable destination page to use and where to display the resulting QR code. 

## How to make the QR code more legible & less complex
- The complexity of a QR code is determined by the length of the string of text, meaning longer QR codes result in more complex QR codes.
- A possible solution is to use a URL shortener.

## Best practices:
- The more space around the QR code, the easier it is to be scanned by devices, generally a 2cm x 2cm code is suitable.
- You can have QR codes to use custom colors however, use high-contrast color combinations for successful scans.
